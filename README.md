## Talking Custom Tooltips


</div>

### Description

This demo application demonstrates the use of a Custom Tooltip Class supporting square and ballon style tooltips, centered at the corresponding control or at the mouse pointer hot spot, with or without title. Individual back- and forecolors and fonts are also possible as well as an assortment of Icons to be displayed in the tooltip and finally individual delay- and show-times. And whats more - the tooltip can now speak using Microsoft's Speech Object Library (SpVoice in sapi.dll), no XVoice.dll or VText.dll!

The code is easy to follow and well documented. And on top of that the class is very easy to use. Check it out, download is only 10 kB.
